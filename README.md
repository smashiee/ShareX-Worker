## Setup
- [Fork](https://github.com/aStonePenguin/ShareX-Worker/fork) this repository.
- Sign up for [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and setup your domain there if you already haven't.
	- Navigate to your domain, "Security", "WAF" and finally the "Rate limiting rules" tab.
		- Click "Create Rule".
		- Give it a name.
		- Click "Edit Expression" and paste the following: `(not http.request.uri.path contains "/assets")`.
		- Set "Requests" to 20 (you can raise this in the future if it's too low).
		- Set all other options to their default.
		- Click deploy.
		- **Do not skip this step, your site will be vulnerable to bruteforce attacks otherwise.**
	- Under "Storage & Databases" on the CloudFlare homepage open "KV" create a new KV namespace.
		- Make note of the ID for later.
	- Under "R2 Object Storage" on the CloudFlare homepage create a bucket, leave the settings as their defaults if you don't know what they do and give it a name.
		- Open the bucket you just created, head to the settings tab and connect a domain. Example: `r2.yourdomain.com`
		- Click "Add CORS policy" and add "https://yourdomain.com" under "AllowedOrigins" then save.

- Open `wrangler.jsonc` on your repository fork and change all settings with a "CHANGE THIS" comment beside them. You may change the optional settings at this time as well. Commit/save the file.
- Head back to the CloudFlare dashboard, navigate to "Workers & Pages", click "Create" and finally import the repository you created earlier. When prompted to "Configure your project" use the default settings.
	- Wait for your worker to build and deploy. This will take a few minutes.
	- Open the worker you just created, head to the settings tab and under "Variables and Secrets" add an [`API_KEY`](https://github.com/aStonePenguin/ShareX-Worker/blob/master/README.md#api_key---required) and [`SESSION_KEY`](https://github.com/aStonePenguin/ShareX-Worker/blob/master/README.md#session_key---required) as described below under settings.
